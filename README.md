### Introduction

This was my final project during the Ironhack Full-Stack Web Dev Bootcamp in Berlin. We were given one week to build a functioning full-stack web application. 

I chose to build an e-commerce website to sell products that I build in real life - modular synthesizers. In my personal life I design and build modular synthesizer modules and have been slowly building to a semi-professional level. I have recently been selling them on eBay etc. and thought that it would be a great opportunity to use this project to build a fully functioning shop. 

### Goals

The goals of the website are two-fold:

- A functioning e-commerce site for users to browse and purchase my modules
- An admin tool for me to manage my inventory and customer orders

As it is not possible for the public to access the admin side of the website, I have provided some screenshots here.
